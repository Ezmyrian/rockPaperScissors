# rockPaperScissors
In this project I will be creating a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with Javascript.  
It is played against the computer.  The code will randomly return a value for the 
computer to use, take a player input, compare the results, and declare a winner.
The player input will not be case sensitive.  
After writing the initial function, it will be plugged into another function which
will keep score for a 5 round game and then declare a winner at the end.
